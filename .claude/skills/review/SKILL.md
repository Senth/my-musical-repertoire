description: "Independent review gate for my-musical-repertoire. Runs the mechanical gates, then diff-review, then — only if that says the change is user-visible — browser-review, fixing what each finds. Use after implementing a feature, a fix or a cleanup, before /ship. Not for planning or for reviewing someone else's PR."

# Review skill

The session that wrote the code does not sign it off. Run this in a **fresh session**:
it starts nearly empty, reads only the diff, the findings and the files it must touch,
so every fix round lands on a small context instead of on top of an entire
implementation.

**You are the fix loop.** The agents are read-only by design. Never give a reviewer
write access, and never ask a reviewer to fix its own finding.

Talk to the user in **unslop** prose — plain, direct, no filler. Not caveman: this
output is small and you read it every run, so clarity beats compression. The agents are
the ones under caveman.

## The order, and why

Free things first, then cheap things, then expensive things.

```
lint → invariants → typecheck → test → e2e     (zero tokens; a shell command each)
        ↓
diff-review                                     (tokens; decides user-visible)
        ↓
browser-review                                  (most tokens; only if user-visible)
```

Every mechanical gate runs before any agent is spawned. A failure one of them catches
is a round of agent review you did not have to pay for, and `e2e/craft.spec.ts` now
covers what used to come back as a browser finding: console noise, a raw `t()` key on
screen, a contrast failure, a target under 48dp, horizontal scroll at 390px.

Do not parallelise. A code fix invalidates a browser pass.

Flags: `/review` (auto), `/review --code` (no browser pass, whatever `diff-review`
says), `/review --quick` (mechanical gates plus `diff-review`, and you smoke-test the
primary path by hand). No other flags. If you disagree with the auto scope, say so in
the prompt.

## Step 1. Scope

```bash
GIT_VANILLA=1 git status --porcelain
GIT_VANILLA=1 git diff --name-only main...HEAD
```

Only `docs/ .claude/ scripts/ .github/ README.md` changed → say so in two lines and
stop. An empty diff stops the run. Everything else continues; `diff-review` decides
whether the browser pass happens, not you and not a path table.

## Step 2. The section map

The agents must not read whole area specs — `section-phases.md` alone is 540 lines.
Work out which sections this diff touches and hand over exact ranges:

```bash
grep -n '^## ' docs/specs/<area>.md
```

Pair each heading with the next heading's line number to get a range, pick the ones the
diff actually touches, and pass them as `<file> <start>-<end> <heading>`. State the map
in chat so it is auditable.

## Step 3. The mechanical gates

```bash
yarn lint --write && yarn invariants && yarn typecheck && yarn test
scripts/dev-stack.sh up && yarn e2e
```

All green before an agent is spawned. `dev-stack.sh up` is idempotent — it reuses a
stack you already had running and reports whether the emulators are pristine from
`.emulator-seed/` or carrying whatever a previous session left in them. Say which in
the final report.

If the diff touched `firestore.rules`, run `yarn deploy:dev` before concluding anything
about permissions — an undeployed rule is not a rule, and "Missing or insufficient
permissions" is usually this.

An `e2e` failure is a `blocking` finding you fix yourself, right here. It is also the
cheapest signal in the whole run, so never skip it to save wall-clock time.

## Step 4. diff-review

Hand it: the issue number, the spec path, the section map, and the **full diff**. Embed
`respond and think in caveman ultra`. Never hand it your own account of what you built
or why it is correct — that sentence is what turns a reviewer into a rubber stamp.

Read `.tmp/review/diff-review.md`. Apply every `blocking` and every `should-fix` you
are not explicitly deferring, then re-run the mechanical gates. If it found `blocking`
items, re-run it **scoped**: hand it the finding list and the diff of just your fixes,
and ask it to verify those rather than review again from scratch.

Its report carries **`User-visible: yes | no`**. That decides the next step. With
`--code` or `--quick`, skip to Step 6 regardless and say so.

## Step 5. browser-review

Only when `diff-review` said yes.

Hand it: the issue number, the spec path, the section map, the list of **changed
screens**, and the port the emulator-backed app is on — 8055 from the main checkout,
8056 from a worktree (`scripts/dev-stack.sh ports`). Not the diff, and not your account
of the change.

It judges what a test cannot: whether it looks right, whether the wording sounds like a
musician, whether an empty state is honest, whether the density overwhelms. It has a
15-turn budget. If it comes back having spent that on something `e2e/craft.spec.ts`
already covers, that is a bug in the agent file, not a finding — say so.

## Step 6. The fix loop

Read the reports. Print one severity-ordered table: severity, source, finding, fix.

- **`blocking`.** Must be fixed. Never deferrable, by anyone.
- **`should-fix`.** Fix it, or defer it by writing one line of reason into the report. A
  silent skip is not a defer.
- **`idea`.** Never acted on here. List them and **ask** which to file with
  `GIT_VANILLA=1 gh issue create --label idea`, then `scripts/sync-todo.sh`. The rest
  are dropped. Never file one without asking, and never file them all by default.

While not PASS and rounds used **< 2**:

1. Apply the fixes yourself.
2. Re-run the mechanical gates. All green.
3. **Re-run scoped, not whole.** Hand the agent the list of fixes and ask it to verify
   exactly those. Do not re-run `diff-review` unless a fix changed logic rather than
   presentation.
4. Count the round.

**PASS** = zero `blocking` and zero outstanding `should-fix`.

After two rounds without a PASS, **stop**. Print what is outstanding, say which rounds
were spent, ask how to proceed. Do not keep grinding.

## Step 7. Report, and tear down

State plainly: PASS or NOT PASS, rounds used, what was fixed, what was deferred and
why, which ideas were filed, whether the emulators were pristine, and whether
`firestore.rules` still needs deploying. If no browser pass happened, say why —
`diff-review` said not user-visible, or a flag — and what you smoke-tested by hand
instead.

```bash
scripts/dev-stack.sh down
playwright-cli -s=review close
```

Only if you started the stack. `down` stops what it started and leaves anything else
alone.

Reports and screenshots stay in `.tmp/review/`. Gitignored, never committed, nothing
posted to GitHub.

On a PASS, tell the user to run **`/ship`** in a fresh session. Do not fold the spec,
open a PR or merge from here.

## The seed fixture

`.emulator-seed/` is committed and produced **by the app**, never hand-written — see
[`docs/OPERATIONS.md`](../../../docs/OPERATIONS.md) for the regeneration procedure and
what it holds.

It is a contract with `e2e/support/app.ts`: the seeded account, the readiness markers,
and every title a spec waits on. A feature's `/ship` refreshes it when the feature adds
data worth having in every future review. **A stale fixture is a `blocking` finding on
the feature that broke it.**
