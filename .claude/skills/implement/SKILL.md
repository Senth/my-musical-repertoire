Use in a fresh session after /new-feature, /cleanup or /bug has written a spec. Stops before review. Not for planning and not for shipping."

# Implement skill

Runs the **Phases** of a spec, in order, and nothing else. Planning happened in
`/new-feature`, `/cleanup` or `/bug`. Review happens in `/review`. Shipping happens in
`/ship`. Each is a fresh session, and that is the point: this one holds the spec, the
phase list and a section map, not five phases of accumulated implementation.

Talk to the user in **unslop** prose.

## Why sub-agents

One session working five phases carries every earlier phase into every later turn, so
its cost grows with roughly the square of the phase count. Handing each phase to its
own agent flattens that, at the price of one context re-load per phase. Break-even is
around three phases.

**Below three phases, do the work yourself** — under `ponytail` in `full` mode, the
same as an agent would. The handoff costs more than it saves, and a two-phase spec is
one sitting.

## Step 0: input

A spec path, usually `docs/specs/wip/<nn>-<slug>.md`. Read it whole — it is short, it
is the contract, and it is the only thing you are carrying.

Confirm the branch is the feature's own, not `main`:

```bash
GIT_VANILLA=1 git branch --show-current
```

If it is `main`, stop and say so. Merging to `main` deploys to production.

## Step 1: the section map

Build it once and hand the same map to every phase agent, so no agent reads a 540-line
area spec to change forty lines:

```bash
grep -n '^## ' docs/specs/<area>.md
```

Pair each heading with the next heading's line to get ranges, keep the ones this spec
touches, and pass them as `<file> <start>-<end> <heading>`.

## Step 2: the phase loop

For each phase, in order:

1. **Dispatch.** `feature-small` for a tightly-scoped slice, `feature-large` for a
   multi-file one with real design in it; `bug-small` / `bug-large` when the spec came
   from `/bug`. The spec says which per phase; if it does not, judge from the phase's
   scope and say what you chose. Hand over: the spec path, **which phase**, the section
   map, the instruction to **invoke the `ponytail` skill in `full` mode**, and the
   instruction to respond and think in **caveman ultra**.

   Ponytail is not optional. The spec decided *what* to build; ponytail decides how
   much code that takes. Catching an unnecessary abstraction at write time is a
   deletion; catching it in `diff-review` is a rewrite.

2. **Verify it yourself.** Never take the agent's word for green:

   ```bash
   yarn lint --write && yarn invariants && yarn typecheck && yarn test
   ```

   A phase that touches user-visible surface also owes its `e2e/` tests — the spec's
   Acceptance claims tagged `[test]` become real specs in the phase that builds the
   screen, not later, and `yarn invariants` fails until the test titles match the
   claims. Run them when the phase adds them:

   ```bash
   scripts/dev-stack.sh up && yarn e2e
   ```

3. **Red?** Send the failure back to the **same agent** with the output, and let it fix
   its own phase. Two rounds. Still red after that, stop and report — do not start
   fixing another agent's phase yourself, and do not move to the next phase on red.

4. **Commit.** One commit per phase, once it is green. The agent commits its own phase;
   if it did not, do it:

   ```bash
   GIT_VANILLA=1 git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <phase summary>"
   ```

5. Report the phase in one line and move on.

## Step 3: stop

When the last implementation phase is green and committed, **stop**. Do not review your
own work, do not fold the spec, do not open a PR.

Tell the user: run **`/review`** in a fresh session. Say which phases landed, which
commits, whether `firestore.rules` changed and therefore needs `yarn deploy:dev`, and
anything the spec left as an open decision.

## What does not belong here

- **Reviewing.** The session that wrote the code never signs it off, and dispatching
  agents still counts as writing it.
- **Folding the wip spec into `docs/specs/`.** That is `/ship`, after a PASS.
- **Deciding scope.** If a phase turns out to be wrong or the spec is ambiguous, stop
  and ask. Do not redesign mid-run; a spec changed silently during implementation is a
  spec nobody agreed to.
- **Committing anything outside the phase list.** Drive-by fixes belong in their own
  issue.
