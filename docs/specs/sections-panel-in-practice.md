# Spec: Sections Panel in Piece Practice Screen

## Phase 0: Handoff

**Spec file:** `docs/specs/sections-panel-in-practice.md`

**Implementer instructions:**
- Use the Phases section (Phase 1–6) as your implementation plan. No separate PLAN.md needed.
- After all phases are verified working, check off these items in `PLAN.md`:
  - `- [ ] Sections should be displayed at bottom (between Memory mistakes and Save button)`
  - `- [ ] Display all sections in a compact list with label + progress line (current BPM vs target BPM) + Practice button for each section.`
  - `- [ ] When practing the full piece, but having mistakes it would be good to select specific sections that were problematic to focus on those. Unsure how to present this in the UI in a good way.`
- Run `yarn lint` after each phase. Fix all issues including pre-existing ones.
- Manual testing via playwright skill (login: senth.wallace@gmail.com / hellomynameispassword123, local server at http://localhost:8081).
- Never commit — user reviews and commits manually.
- Respond in caveman ultra.

## 1. What

Add a sections panel to the piece practice screen — displayed between Memory mistakes and Save button — showing all sections with phase chip, BPM progress, optional notes, and a Practice button. When mistakes ≥ some, the panel switches to a checkbox mode so the student can flag problematic sections before saving.

## 2. Why

A student who runs through the full piece and makes mistakes needs to immediately identify and drill the weak spots. The current screen offers no visibility into per-section progress during practice, and no structured way to flag problem areas. This panel:

- Surfaces section progress (phase + BPM gap) without leaving the practice flow
- Lets the student navigate directly to a focused section practice session
- Captures which sections caused problems, feeding the future recommendation engine
- Replaces the existing modal section picker (which was only marginally useful and creates two competing UIs)

## 3. Data Model

### `PiecePractice` document (Firestore: `users/{uid}/pieces/{pieceId}/practices/{id}`)

Add two new fields:

```typescript
flaggedSectionIds?: string[] | null   // sections student marked as problematic
triggeredFrom?: 'full-piece' | 'section-panel' | 'direct'  // how the practice was initiated
```

Updated `PiecePractice` interface in `models/practice.ts`:

```typescript
export interface PiecePractice {
  id?: string;
  pieceId: string;
  date: Date;
  technicalMistakes: PracticeMistakes;
  memoryMistakes: PracticeMistakes;
  achievedBpm?: number | null;
  sectionId?: string | null;
  flaggedSectionIds?: string[] | null;
  triggeredFrom?: 'full-piece' | 'section-panel' | 'direct';
}
```

No Firestore schema migration needed — new fields are additive and nullable.

## 4. UI Flow

### Full-piece practice screen (`/piece/[id]/practice`)

**REMOVED:**
- `List.Item` at top (section picker that opens RadioButton modal)
- `Modal` with `RadioButton.Group` for section selection
- The `selectedSectionId` state that drove the top picker

**LAYOUT AFTER:**

```
Piece title + composer + last practiced

────────────────────
BPM input + Metronome button

────────────────────
Technical mistakes  (SegmentedButtons)

Memory mistakes     (SegmentedButtons)

────────────────────
Sections panel      ← NEW (hidden if piece has no sections)

Save button
```

### Sections panel — normal mode (mistakes < some)

```
Sections
────────────────────────────────────────────
Bridge  [learning]     72 / 96 BPM   [Practice →]
          LH leaps
Coda    [stabilizing]  60 / 96 BPM   [Practice →]
Intro   [maintenance]  96 / — BPM    [Practice →]
          Memory insecure
```

- Section label + phase chip (colored)
- BPM line: `currentBpm / targetBpm BPM`
  - `targetBpm` = `section.targetBpmOverride` if set, else `piece.targetTempoBpm`
  - Missing value shown as `—`
  - If both are null: BPM line hidden
- Notes shown as subtitle when `section.notes` is non-empty
- `[Practice →]` button navigates to `/piece/[id]/practice?sectionId=[sectionId]&from=[original-from]`

### Sections panel — checkbox mode (mistakes ≥ some)

Activates when `technicalMistakes >= PracticeMistakes.some OR memoryMistakes >= PracticeMistakes.some`.

Header changes to: **"Sections — tap the ones that were problematic"**

Each row gains a checkbox on the left. `[Practice →]` button remains.

```
Sections — tap the ones that were problematic
────────────────────────────────────────────
[☐] Bridge  [learning]     72 / 96 BPM   [Practice →]
[☑] Coda    [stabilizing]  60 / 96 BPM   [Practice →]
[☐] Intro   [maintenance]  96 / — BPM    [Practice →]
```

Checked section IDs are included in `flaggedSectionIds` when Save is pressed.

### Section-scoped practice (navigated to from panel)

Same `/piece/[id]/practice` screen, but `sectionId` passed as a query param. The screen:
- Pre-selects that section (BPM prefills from `section.currentBpm`)
- `triggeredFrom` = `'section-panel'` on save

### Full-piece practice save

On Save:
- `triggeredFrom` = `'full-piece'`
- `flaggedSectionIds` = checked section IDs (empty array if checkbox mode not triggered or none checked)

### PracticeComparison screen

No changes in this feature. Flagged sections are recorded in Firestore but not yet surfaced in the comparison UI (deferred to Phase 4 recommendation engine).

## 5. Logging

Per practice save, the Firestore document captures:

| Field | When set | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `flaggedSectionIds` | Full-piece practice when sections exist | Feed recommender: which sections need attention |
| `triggeredFrom` | Every save | Recommender: distinguish proactive drill vs error-driven drill |

## 6. Out of Scope

- `focusType` field (accuracy / tempo-building / continuity / memory) — deferred to per-block logging phase
- Duration estimate per section — deferred
- "Fixed" resolution state per flagged section — deferred
- Showing flagged sections in PracticeComparison — deferred to Phase 4
- Surfacing flagged sections in Overview / session planner — deferred to Phase 4

## 7. Phases

### Phase 1: Data model + hook updates

- Update `models/practice.ts`: add `flaggedSectionIds` and `triggeredFrom` to `PiecePractice` interface
- Update `hooks/use-practices.ts` `savePractice` to accept and write `flaggedSectionIds` and `triggeredFrom`
- Update `app/(app)/piece/[id]/practice.tsx`: pass `triggeredFrom: 'full-piece'` on save; remove `selectedSectionId` state from the full-piece flow (top picker gone)

### Phase 2: Sections panel component

- Create `components/practice/SectionsPracticePanel.tsx`
  - Props: `sections: Section[]`, `piece: Piece`, `mistakeLevel: 'normal' | 'checkbox'`, `flaggedIds: string[]`, `onToggleFlag: (id: string) => void`, `onPractice: (sectionId: string) => void`
  - Renders section rows with: label, phase chip, BPM line (`currentBpm` / effective target), optional notes subtitle
  - `mistakeLevel === 'checkbox'`: shows checkbox on each row; changes header text
  - Phase chip colors: `learning` = primary, `stabilizing` = secondary, `maintenance` = tertiary (use theme tokens)
  - Hidden entirely when `sections` is empty

### Phase 3: Wire panel into practice screen

- Remove `List.Item` section picker, `Modal`, `RadioButton.Group`, `sectionPickerVisible` state, `selectedSectionId` state
- Add `flaggedSectionIds: string[]` state
- Add `showCheckboxes` derived value: `technicalMistakes >= PracticeMistakes.some || memoryMistakes >= PracticeMistakes.some`
- Render `<SectionsPracticePanel>` between Memory mistakes and Save button
- `onPractice` handler: navigate to `/piece/${id}/practice?sectionId=${sid}&from=${from ?? 'overview'}`
- Pass `triggeredFrom: 'full-piece'` + `flaggedSectionIds` to `savePractice`

### Phase 4: Section-scoped practice wires `triggeredFrom`

- In `practice.tsx`, detect `sectionId` query param
- When `sectionId` present: pass `triggeredFrom: 'section-panel'` on save
- Ensure BPM prefills from section's `currentBpm` (already works via existing `useEffect`)

### Phase 5: i18n + a11y

- Add all new translation keys (section panel header, checkbox mode header, BPM format strings, phase chip labels)
- Add `accessibilityLabel` to phase chips and checkbox rows
- Verify no hardcoded strings

### Phase 6: Tests + playwright verification

- Run `yarn lint` and fix all issues
- Manual test via playwright:
  - Piece with sections: panel visible, BPM values correct, phase chips shown, notes shown
  - Piece with no sections: panel hidden
  - Mistakes < some: no checkboxes shown
  - Mistakes ≥ some: checkboxes appear, can check/uncheck
  - Practice button navigates to section-scoped screen with correct prefill
  - Save records `flaggedSectionIds` and `triggeredFrom` in Firestore (verify via browser devtools / Firebase console)
  - Section-scoped save records `triggeredFrom: 'section-panel'`
